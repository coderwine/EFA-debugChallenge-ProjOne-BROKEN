# EFA-debugChallenge-ProjOne-BROKEN

**Main Concept:**
- This challenge has three different APIs that we are trying to fix.  The purpose of this challenge is to practice debugging a broken application to get it into a working format.  **DO NOT MODIFY THE MODAL**.  There are comments in the code warning against this.  EVERYTHING else is fair game.

- We are using Bootstrap and customized CSS.  Each API has its own JS and CSS files.  This isn't the cleanest code when completed but functional. This is not the fastest app. Feel free to clean it up if you so desire.  It will be important to consider the limitations of the APIs being used and read the docs provided.  In all levels of the challenge, it will be expected to fix issues within the JS and CSS files (possibly in relation to the HTML).  Remember to use console.log() to your advantage.

**Bronze:**
- You will be focused on getting the Quote API functional.  Here is the link to the documentation for the Quote API.  The goal is to trigger a quote at the bottom of the page whenever the Submit Button is CLICKED.
- There will also be a "next" button that will allow us to generate a new quote.

**Silver:**
- In this portion of the challenge, we will use an input to search a city name and create a card to display a quick readout of weather in that city.  We will also display our temperatures in Fahrenheit.  Here is the documentation for Weather Stack to look over.  We will be displaying the name of the location as well and changing the background of our display depending on the weather conditions.  *how can we test for those conditions?

**Gold:**
- For Gold, we will be displaying 3 random restaurants within a collection of "hot spots" as images that we can then click and view in a new tab.  *Consider the limitations and if a user searches a location that may have less than 3 restaurants listed.
